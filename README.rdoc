=Important note

I will not continue developing these recipes. They are superseeded by:
https://github.com/leifcr/capistrano-puma
https://github.com/leifcr/capistrano-delayed_job
https://github.com/leifcr/capistrano-base_helper

Bluepill was quite good back in the days, then the code went haywire and too unstable for production.

The new recipes are for monit/runit which are almost "too" reliable...
